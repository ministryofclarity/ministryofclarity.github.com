Orienting and informing 250+ programmer nerds in a large venue, in a city like New York City, presents many issues. Many conference lanyards are clumsy, large, and ugly - which all affect their retention. Sponsors also pay big dollars to feature their brand image on many of the materials at the conference. Creating memorable keepsakes which the attendees can take home appeals to sponsors and attendees alike.

###Solution
A simple conference badge that features the name of the attendee on the front, yet when they swing the badge up to read, has the entire program contained inside.
