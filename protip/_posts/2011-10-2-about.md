## Advocates for user frustration

We want to alert these creators of their poor design choices. Many times these individuals are extremely talented, yet the teams and companies they work for twist their ability into heinous collections of adequate thought. Their products may meet the specifications, but not user expectations. __We are advocates for frustrated users everywhere.__

## Stop bitching and tell us

See a victim of poor design? Tell us! We want to hear about the items you use in your day-to-day life that do not meet your expectations.
