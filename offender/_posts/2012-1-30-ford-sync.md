Seriously Ford - what the fuck?! You want me to believe that average American drivers can safely navigate an interface without any tactile feedback? They make GPS systems have a disclaimer not to use them while driving since you have to take your eyes off the road. Now you are making the driver take his or her eyes off the road to turn the heat down? Or even to change the radio?

Your solution to have not one, but two D-pad style controls on the wheel do not help. That interacts with an interface that is next to the speedometer, not the center panel.

Oh &#8212; you want to see __the worst part__? A shiny plastic center console with printed on button indicators. You can't even feel the printed outlines since they are under another layer of plastic.

I drove the Edge for over 5 hours over the holidays and did not use that dial in the middle at all.  After parking the car I used it once and found out it turns the stereo down.

Shiny electronics must move cars out of the showroom for Ford... Then lure patrons back in after they crash their car turning their seat heater down.
